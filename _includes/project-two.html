        <h2>MoviePedia</h2>
        <p class="intro-text">I had to build my first full-stack app using<span class="highlight"> Node.js and Express</span>. I created a movie search app called MoviePedia.<br><br>
          For this project, I had to create an app which includes two models at least, with <span class="skill">user authentication</span>. I also used an external API for movies called OMDB. Following the first project process, I used <span class="skill">Balsamiq</span> online software to create the wireframes and decide on the user interface and navigation. In addition, I used the  <span class="skill">Bootstrap</span> framework.
