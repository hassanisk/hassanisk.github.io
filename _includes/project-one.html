        <h2>Alien Attack</h2>
        <p class="intro-text">I had a week to a build an interactive game using HTML, CSS, SCSS, JavaScript and jQuery. At first I had to come with an idea for the project, and after a discuss with the T.Aâ€™s I decided to create a duck hunt style game called Alien Attack.<br><br>

          I started with planning and pseudocoding the process. Then I began writing the functionality and build the logic of the game. After that, I started building the CSS and giving the game a cool modern look.<br><br>

          This project was super beneficial for me since it was the first project I create by myself and it was fun.
