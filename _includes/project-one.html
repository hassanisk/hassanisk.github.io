        <h2>Alien Attack</h2>
        <p class="intro-text">I had a week to a build an interactive game using <span class="highlight">HTML, CSS, SCSS, JavaScript</span> and <span class="highlight">jQuery</span>. I first had to come up with an idea for the project. After a discussion with the Teaching Assistant, I decided to create a ‘duck hunt’ style game called Alien Attack.<br><br>

        I started with <span class="skill">planning and pseudocoding </span>the process. I then began developing the functionality and building the logic of the game. After that, I then started building the CSS and giving the game a ‘cool’ and ‘modern’ look.<br><br>
        This project was extremely insightful for me, as it was the first project that I created on my own.
