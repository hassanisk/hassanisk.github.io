      <h2>About Hassan Iskaf</h2>
      <p> I moved to London several years ago to study my Masterâ€™s in Information Systems and Technology at <a href="https://www.city.ac.uk/">City University</a> and then I did a web development course at <a href="https://generalassemb.ly/">General Assembly</a> in London. <p>Over the last three months I have learned a huge amount which has complemented my previous studies.
      </p>
      <p>I am looking for a career path that will enable me to continue this learning process and develop further skills.
